## Background

This is why this application exists.

The point for this application is so that I can try and have fun creating amusing conversations with the chatbot and how others might think of it.

## Install
These are the steps to setup your local environment to run this application.

To use this application, you would only need to have the link and run the program.

## Usage

These are the steps to use the application or interact with it.

So far, you can only have a few lines of conversation before the program is done so I'm hoping to try and connect the conversations and make it flow better.
